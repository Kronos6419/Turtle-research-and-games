# Turtle Maze Research

This readme is to provide a brief overview on my attempts to make a turtle maze game.

## Overview

Based on the provided task I researched different options into what I could try to put together and found a "turtle maze" or the snake game being a rather popular beginner choice to try coding.

### How to use?

most of the instructions are present in the file itself and self explanatory, I've tried to utilize keyboard inputs to control the turtle and navigate the maze

### References and Research

Here are some of the codes, websites and forums I visited to get an idea how to work on this.
